# Platformer

A complete demo of a platformer game, with

- Level (and all UI) designed visually using the editor.

- Sprites sheets designed using CGE editor and managed in .castle-sprite-sheet format (see [sprite sheets docs](https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Sprite-sheets)).

- Full platformer gameplay. Player can move, jump, pick up a weapon, be hurt by enemies, be hurt by obstacles, collect things, die, finish the level. Extra jumps in the air are possible (check out _Advanced player_ checkbox). Enemies move following a simple pattern.

- Sound and music.

- All UI states you expect from a usual game â€” main menu, options (with volume configuration), pause, credits, game over and of course the actual game.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).
