Demo of using _Castle Game Engine_ "shader effects"
described on https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders.php .

The demo adds an `Effect` node by code,
and also shows how to manipulate custom `Effect` parameter (which maps to GLSL uniform)
at runtime.
These effects use shader code (GLSL, running on GPU) that is automatically
integrated with standard engine rendering shaders.

See https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders.php and in particular
https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders_doc/html/ about shader effects.
