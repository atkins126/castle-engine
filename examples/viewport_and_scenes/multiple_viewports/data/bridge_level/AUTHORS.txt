    From Golgotha project.
    The resources were hosted on various websites throughout the years, like

    http://jonathanclark.com/textures/
    http://www.wolfiesden.com/golgotha/golgotha.asp

    The current one alive is http://opengameart.org/content/golgotha-textures ,
    although it only contains a subset of the original images.
    There is also http://sourceforge.net/projects/golgotha/ ,
    but it doesn't seem to contain textures (at least not in any normal format).
