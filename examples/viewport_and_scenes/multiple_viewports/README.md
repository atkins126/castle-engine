# Multiple Viewports

Demo of using multiple viewports (`TCastleViewport` instances) to view the same world.
All `TCastleViewport` instances share the same `TCastleViewport.Items` reference.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

## Building

Compile by:

- [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php). Just use menu item _"Compile"_.

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `multiple_viewports_standalone.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/documentation.php).
