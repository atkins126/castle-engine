# Cross-platform CGE test

This is a cross-platform CGE application that tests various engine features:

- shows some 2D controls (buttons, images),
- shows a viewport with 3D scene and screen effect,
- allows to navigate in the viewport even on mobile, using TCastleTouchNavigation,
- plays some sounds,
- makes vibrations (on mobile),
- tests modal boxes (OK on desktops and Android, but not on iOS).

See https://castle-engine.io/manual_cross_platform.php for information how to compile and run it on various devices.
