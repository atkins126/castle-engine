2D game with models animated in Spine.

Records and shows achievements using CastleGameService. This uses:

- Google Play Games (on Android)
- Apple Game Center (on iOS)
- On other platforms achievements are ignored now.
  In the future we may integrate e.g. with Steam achievements,
  if a Steam service is activated in the project.

This is now very similar to the "New Project -> 2D Game" template from the CGE editor,
extended only to demonstrate achievements.
