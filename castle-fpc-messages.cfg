# Customize messages displayed by FPC.
#
# FPC emits some messages that are unfortunately useless and unavoidable in user code,
# especially when using Generics.Collections.
# Every specializatoin of a generic container produces a number of messages
# that are not actionable.
# So we hide them, by using proper -vmXXX options.
#
# Why like this?
#
# - We hide messages selectively, by -vmXXX.
#   We don't want to unconditionally hide all FPC warnings,
#   as many FPC warnings are very useful to easily spot code problems.
#   We also don't want to train our eyes to ignore the warnings :),
#   which would happen if the output would be flooded by useless warnings.
#   Our applications should have a "clean" output from FPC,
#   with warnings + notes enabled.
#
# - Note that -vmXXXX has to be used conditionally, looking at FPC version,
#   for some messages. Otherwise older FPC versions would fail when they see
#   unrecognized -vmXXXX message.
#   The currently supported FPC versions by CGE are documented on
#   https://castle-engine.io/supported_compilers.php .
#
# - This is a subset of castle-fpc.cfg, useful to refer to from Lazarus LPI/LPK.
#   Using a common cfg file allows to share this logic between various LPI/LPK files.
#   Also, in Lazarus LPI it seems not possible to use stuff like
#   "if GetProjValue('FPC_FULLVERSION') >= 30101 then" in "Common options"
#   (although it works in Lazarus LPK).
#
# Note that Castle Game Engine build tool
# (see https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Build-Tool )
# has better filtering implementation,
# and instead of using -vmXXX it can (in some cases) filter out specific cases
# related to Generics.Collections.
# Our build tool doesn't use this cfg file.
